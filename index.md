# Yifan Hou's User Page

## [Basic Information]

![alt text](https://github.com/yexiu52937/cse110fa21/blob/main/My%20photo.jpg?raw=true)

I'm **Yifan Hou** from China, currently a student major in math-cs in UCSD. I've taken some courses about algorithm and programming, also some courses in math department.

I believe it's good to be familiar with various different languages, and here I have a task list for it:
- [x] Java
- [x] C
- [x] C++
- [ ] Python
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] ...

Well, although there are still many languages I haven't try, right now ss a programmer, my favorite programming language is java.
The first code I learnt is written in Java: `System.out.println("Hello World");`

Outside of school, I have some hobbies:

- drawing pictures
- playing game
- watching Japanese anime.

Here's a [website introducing the anime and manga](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen_Wiki) I recently watched.

And I also want to share the photo of a [Faience picture I made](./00.jpg) a few months ago.

Besides, I also watch movies sometimes, there are some words that emphasize me, like the one in *The Truman Show*:

> The world may be full of cheating, however we never lack friends with a warm heart.

This page is created for my cse 110 course, and I hope to learn the following from this course:
1. be more familiar with programming and programming languages
2. learn what actually is "software engineering"
3. have some idea about how to start the development of a software
4. I also aspire to learn more that I haven't expected!
